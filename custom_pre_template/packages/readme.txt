# any .deb files here are installed using dpkg -i *.deb after
# running ../setup (if it exists) but before extracting ../overlay.tar.xz (if it exists)

# if you find packages here already installed by `fleetsie_mod install`, then you should
# assume they are required for use by fleetsie during provisioning and/or after
# deployment, and so you should not remove them.
